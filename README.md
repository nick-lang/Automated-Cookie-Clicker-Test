# Automated Cookie Clicker Test
This is a Cucumber test that uses Gradle, Groovy, and Selenium WebDriver to automate one click on Cookie Clicker(not my app).

## To Run
Chrome WebDriver must be placed in the build/lib folder.
With the appropriate technologies and project installed, "gradle cucumber" can be executed from the command line while in the project directory to run the test.

## Bugs
I am still working on getting Cucumber hooks to work. This would help clean up a lot of the code.
